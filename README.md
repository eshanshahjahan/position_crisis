Position Crisis - Oculus Rift + Razer Hydra WebGL demo

This is a demo of using one Razer Hydra wand to add positional tracking to the Oculus Rift and the other as a gun controller.

It is built on two excellent libraries:

three.js - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/
vr.js - https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js

It requires the following:

Oculus Rift
Razer Hydra - affix the left wand to the Rift
Browser plugin to access those two, bundled with vr.js (installation instructions there)

Controls:

Head and gun both have 6 degrees of freedom
Spacebar reorients the view
Right Hydra wand trigger fires
Right Hydra start button resets game state
